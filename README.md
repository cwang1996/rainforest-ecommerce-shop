## Introduction
This is a code repository for my Rainforest e-commerce website. A shopify-theme inspired website that was built using:
- React
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Styled Components
- Stripe.js

Notable Features:

-   Fully responsive custom styling through styled components
-   Browse through the products catalog and filter based on category of furniture as well as price
-   Products generated through a backend database (MongoDB)
-   Checkout products by using Stripe's payment processing platform

Featured ideas to implement:

- Login and register for both admin and users.
- Admin dashboard with ability to track sales and revenue as well as add or remove products.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
